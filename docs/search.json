    "text": "original order of presentation\nThe original presentation of the survey begins with professional and PsychoPy background questions. It then proceeds to issues of equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) for respondents who indicated that they not only are part of a particular identity of interest, but also feel they have been affected somehow by having that identity in the PsychoPy community. The survey finished with a few questions about the Code of Conduct and documentation, which we will simply call PsychoPy guidance. Thus:\n\nProfessional and PsychoPy background\n\nEDI experience\n\nPsychoPy guidance\n\nEach participant saw the all of the professional and PsychoPy background items on the survey, as well as the PsychoPy guidance items. In the section on EDI experience, each respondent saw at least one of the questions, with the exception of gender, in which case everyone saw at least two.\nThe one EDI questions that everyone saw had to do with whether they identified with, or was typically associated with, one of the EDI groups. In the case of gender, they simply indicated what their gender was, or if it was not listed.\nIf they answered yes to any particular EDI question (or any response for gender), two more questions appeared. The first invited them to supply more specific information about that particular aspect of their identity, but only if they wanted to. The second had to do with whether they felt that this particular aspect of their identity had affected their interactions in the PsychoPy® community.\nImportantly, this latter question determined whether participants saw a further eight questions regarding that particular identity. If they answered yes, they saw those questions a little bit later in the survey. If they answered no, they did not.\nThis has an important implication. Namely, although one may identify or be associated with a particular identity, that does not necessarily mean that one feels that it had affected one’s interactions in the PsychoPy® community. Indeed, there were many participants throughout the survey who felt that although they are associated with a particular identity, it had not affected their interactions.\nRecall that for the dimension of gender, everyone saw the question concerning whether they felt that their interactions had suffered as a result of gender. This is because everyone has a gender identity, so there was no logical way of excluding anyone from seeing the subsequent community-interaction question."

Specifically, it would be informative to see how the background variables and related issues interact with the EDI variables. Therefore, the background and guidance variables are presented after the EDI variables, giving us a data-summary order as follows:\n\nEDI experience\n\nProfessional & PsychoPy background\n\nPsychoPy Guidance\n\nEach background and guidance variable is presented in isolation first, but then followed by two-way interactions with the EDI variables of gender, sexual orientation, race/culture, disability/neurodivergence, and written-English language dominance. In some cases, the interactions with the latter four EDI variables are presented in a single figure.\nTo the extent possible, each summary is available as a link in the sidebar. However, some interactions were grouped together and don’t have links, per se. Most commonly, interactions with gender are linked, followed by interactions with other EDI variables.\nNote that none of the questions required responses. This means that there will be plenty of non-responses in the summaries below. These are indicated as either NA or missing."

    "text": "participant EDI experience\nThe second group of items on the survey (again, presented first here) collected information about selected dimensions of equity, diversity, and inclusion, namely gender, sexual orientation, race and/or culture, disability and/or neurodivergence, and language dominance.\nFor each dimension, participants were asked if they identified with the dimension, or whether they thought that others would associate them with it, along with the optional opportunity to supply more information about their own specific identity along this dimension.\nCrucially, they were also asked whether they felt that that identity or association had affected their interactions in the PsychoPy® community. If they answered in the affirmative, they saw eight more questions related to this identity shortly thereafter in the survey.\nThus, the reader will notice that the sample sizes uniformly differ greatly between those who answered the background questions, and those who answered the eight further questions.\nThese eight further questions fell into three categories in the manner shown below:\n\nTreatment by others\n\n\nnegative perception\n\nneed to hide identity\n\ndismissiveness towards contributions\n\ntarget of derisive comments\n\ntarget of microaggressions\n\n\nSelf-regard\n\n\nself-doubt\n\nstereotype threat\n\n\nIsolation\n\n\na desire to interact with others more like themselves\n\n\nParticipants could agree or disagree with each of these statements using a 1-7 Likert scale, where 1 indicated Strongly disagree and a 7 indicated Strongly agree.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that on the 1-7 scale for each of the statements, the number 4 is directly in the middle of the scale, which can be interpreted as neither agreeing nor disagreeing. You will see that we set responses of 4 to the side of the respective stacked frequency barplots, in yellow.\nAlso, the barplots are sorted within each category (treatment, self-regard, and isolation) along descending frequency of agreement. That is, the topmost barplot within each category is the one with highest number of agreements, whereas the bottom-most barplot within each category is the one with the highest number of disagreements.\n\n\nSummaries of the responses to these statements are provided below after the respective questions concerning their identity.\n\ngender\nThe first EDI category is gender. We present the responses to the issue of identity, followed by a table of descriptions (supplied by some of the participants). This is followed by whether the participant felt affected in the PsychoPy® community by that identity. Finally, we summarise the participants responses to items listed under treatment (by others), self-regard, and isolation.\n\nidentity\nThe sections directly below summarise, both visually and verbally, the answer to the following question:\n\nWhich gender do you identify most with?\n\n\nfigure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntable\n\n\nSummary of responses to gender.QuestionN = 2301Which gender do you identify most with?man133 (58%)woman85 (37%)not listed8 (3.5%)(missing)4 (1.7%)1n (%)\n\n\n\ndescriptions\nIf participants chose not listed as an answer above, they were given the opportunity to describe their gender in their own words, though doing so was optional.
