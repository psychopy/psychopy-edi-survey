# edi-survey-code
This is just the code for some EDI surveys, not the data. We don't have permission to store the data on GitHub.

To get the appropriate output, the `.qmd` files must be run in a particular order. Render the `tidyingAndFormatting.qmd` file first, followed by both `summariesAndVisualisations.qmd` and `codebook.qmd`, but not necessarily in that order. These files are designed to render `.html` output, nothing else.
