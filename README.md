# edi-survey-code

This repository will store the anonymised data and data analyses for the survey sent out by *PsychoPy* to gauge equity, diversity, and inclusion among its own user base.

To get the appropriate output from beginning to end, the `.qmd` files must be run in a particular order. Render the `tidyingAndFormatting.qmd` file first, followed by both `summariesAndVisualisations.qmd` and `codebook.qmd`, but not necessarily in that order. These files are designed to render `.html` output, nothing else.

That said, the raw data from *Pavlovia Surveys* is not uploaded here. The only available options from the files available here are to run `summariesAndVisualisations.qmd` and `codebook.qmd`.
